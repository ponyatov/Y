# bI prototyping dynamic language
## `<int>`only version

### why

* object abstract dynamic language for system prototyping
* interface/control/cross-compiler language for tiny embedded systems
(including 8-bit MCU-based)
* computing language with microthreading and HPC features

### requirements

* make
* flex 2.5+
* bison 2.4+
* g++
* any posix-compatible runtime environment (pure embedded/libc or OS-based)
