Any program MUST HAVE scripting ability for CONFIGS and user EXTENSIONS.
bI system provides universal script engine for bI language dialect
and dynamic data types C++ class tree for internal use in generated program.

### goals:

* metaprogramming, computer language design and translator development
* symbolic and numeric computations
* clustering and cloud computing
* complex engineering systems design

### includes:

* [x] dynamic symbolic object subsystem 
* [x] simple Python-inspired metaprogramming language
* [ ] optimizing translator into C++ for target static cross-compilation
* [ ] rich GUI/CAD/Visualization environment with MVC architecture
* [ ] parallel programming subsystem for clustering and cloud computing
* [ ] symbolic math engine
* [ ] FFI: .so/.dll and [D]COM integration
