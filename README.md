.sec Goal

.list The goal of bI language design is
.li ultra high level scripting, programming and design system, supports
.li dynamic metaprogramming on large computers,
.li statical cross-compilation for tiny embedded systems,
.li hardware design including CAD/CAM/CAE/EDA functions,
.li science data crunching and visualization and
.li text data processing including DSL translation and compilers design.

.sec Literate programming

Documentation is program, program must be selfdocumented.

.sec Free Syntax Programming

Language syntax is under your control, bI it mutable DSL for your own tasks.

.sec Composition

bI is composite language, mix of OOP, functional, literate programming,...,
and all modern programming languages.

.sec Bootstrapping

Core language system written in flex, bison and C++,
bI/next (next generation) is realized in bI themself.

.sec+ Core system model
