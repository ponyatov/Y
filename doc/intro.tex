\secly{Intro}

Any program \emph{must have}\ scripting ability for \emph{configs}\ and 
\emph{user extensions}. \bi\ system provides universal script engine for
\bi\ language dialect and dynamic data types \cpp\ class tree
for internal use in generated program.
I was impressed by \st\ system ideology, \bi\ system follows this way to
gui-powered interactive system for translators design, symbolic computations and
CAD/CAM/EDA environment.

\subsubsection{Goals}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item metaprogramming, computer language design and translator development
\item symbolic and numeric computations
\item clustering and cloud computing
\item complex engineering systems design
\item statical translation to \cpp/\java\ for multiplatform software development
(\win/\lin/\andr) 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Applications}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item universal language for configs and parser for computing programs input data
presented in text format
\item text data and program sources processing  
\item fast GUI programming for tiny helper programs
\item universal template language:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item files generation based on project templates
\item multiplatform high-level software development
\item config files generation and control in clustering systems
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
