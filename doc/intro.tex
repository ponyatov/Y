\secly{Intro}

Any program \emph{must have}\ scripting ability for \emph{configs}\ and 
\emph{user extensions}. \bi\ system provides universal script engine for
\bi\ language dialect and dynamic data types \cpp\ class tree
for internal use in generated program.
I was impressed by \st\ system ideology, \bi\ system follows this way to
\st-like interactive system for translators design, symbolic computations and
CAD/CAM/EDA environment.

\subsubsection{Goals}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item metaprogramming, computer language design and translator development
\item symbolic and numeric computations
\item clustering and cloud computing
\item complex engineering systems design
\item statical translation to \cpp/\java\ for multiplatform software development
(\win/\lin/\andr) 
\end{itemize}
